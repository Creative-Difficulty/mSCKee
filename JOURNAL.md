## 10/31/2025 - 1 - Project scope / Component selection  

My first journal entry for my first hardware project :)

# Rough Scope / Requirements

The first iteration of the keyboard will only be a modification of the one in the guide, as I'm still a beginner at KiCad, electronics and PCB design. These are the main differences between this board and the guide:
- RP2040 instead of nRF microcontroller
- Neopixels or similar LEDs under every key
- Only one chip will be used for both sides (master slave concept)
- Connectivity: Just USB-C, so no battery will be used
- In future iterations: The ability to attach a variety of (magnetic?) modules to the side of the keyboard  with:
	- Rotary encoders (e.g. volume dial)
	- push buttons (e.g. hotswappable additional keys, but also normal buttons
	- toggle switches (could be used for simracing or flight simmming)
	- etc (to be determined)


# Component selection
- Main (Master) Microcontroller: likely RP2040
- Slave: I2C expander or parallel-in shift register which sends data to Master
- For data transmission between master (left side) and slave (right side): Likely TRRS if the bandwidth is sufficient

# First concept design
